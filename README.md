# Next.js 14

## Run Application
In terminal run the following commands:
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

## Important files
### In the app directory:
- page.tsx

This is the component that gets rendered at home url (localhost:3000) because it is the page file in the app directory. This file is fetching the data from our api route and displaying the response.

### In the api directory:
- route.tsx

This is a example of how to create a route in next.js 14. To test the route send a get request to localhost:3000/api
